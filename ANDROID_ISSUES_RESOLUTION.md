# Android Issues Resolution Summary

This document summarizes the resolution of reported Android application issues.

## Issue #1: Android Application Crashes When Searching Archives

### Status: ✅ **RESOLVED** (Fixed in Previous Work)

### Problem Statement
The Android application was experiencing crashes when users attempted to search for Internet Archive items through the mobile Flutter interface.

### Root Causes Identified and Fixed

#### 1. Memory Safety Issues in FFI Callbacks
**Location**: `src/interface/ffi.rs`

CString objects were being created and immediately dropped after passing their pointer to callbacks, causing use-after-free errors on Android.

**Fix Applied**: Proper CString lifetime management with error handling:
```rust
let error_msg = CString::new("error")
    .unwrap_or_else(|_| CString::new("fallback").unwrap());
let error_ptr = error_msg.as_ptr();
completion_callback(false, error_ptr, user_data);
// error_msg dropped naturally after callback completes synchronously
```

#### 2. Insufficient Error Handling in Dart FFI
**Location**: `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart`

The Dart FFI bindings lacked proper null checking and exception handling.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added try-catch blocks around all FFI calls
- Implemented null/empty validation before FFI calls
- Enhanced error messages with context
- Increased timeout from 10s to 30s for metadata fetches
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- Input validation with regex pattern checking

#### 3. Race Conditions in Async Handling
The polling mechanism for metadata completion could fail if callbacks didn't complete properly.

**Fix Applied**: Better async handling with proper timeout management and attempt tracking.

#### 4. JNI Layer Validation Issues
**Location**: `mobile/rust-ffi/src/jni_bridge.rs`

The JNI bridge lacked comprehensive input validation.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added null checks for all JString parameters
- Validated empty/whitespace identifiers
- Enhanced error logging for Android debugging
- Better error propagation to Java/Kotlin layer

### Testing
All changes validated with:
- ✅ Cargo clippy (no warnings)
- ✅ Cargo fmt (code formatted)
- ✅ Unit tests (15/15 passing)
- ✅ Build tests (main library and mobile FFI)

## Issue #2: App Icon Appears Pure White / Material You Theming Not Working

### Status: ✅ **RESOLVED** (Fixed in This PR)

### Problem Statement
The app icon appeared as "pure white" instead of showing the Internet Archive building logo. Additionally, it was not compatible with Material You theming on Android 13+ and would not change colors with the system theme.

### Root Cause Identified
The adaptive icon foreground layer (`ic_launcher_foreground.xml`) incorrectly included a white background rectangle as part of the foreground drawable. This violated Android's adaptive icon design principles where:
- **Foreground layer** should only contain the icon shape itself (transparent background)
- **Background layer** should provide the background color/image
- **Monochrome layer** should reference a single-color version for Material You theming

The white background in the foreground layer caused:
1. The icon to appear as a white square since the foreground white overlapped the background white
2. Material You theming to fail because the monochrome layer also contained the white background

### Fix Applied

#### 1. Removed White Background from Foreground Layer
**File**: `mobile/flutter/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml`

**Before**:
```xml
<vector>
    <!-- White background with rounded corners -->
    <path android:fillColor="#ffffff" android:pathData="..." />
    
    <!-- Internet Archive building (black) -->
    <path android:fillColor="#000000" android:pathData="..." />
</vector>
```

**After**:
```xml
<vector>
    <!-- Internet Archive building (black only, no background) -->
    <path android:fillColor="#000000" android:pathData="..." />
</vector>
```

#### 2. Updated Icon Generation Script
**File**: `scripts/generate-android-icons.sh`

Updated the script to generate foreground drawables without embedded backgrounds, ensuring future icon regenerations maintain the correct structure.

#### 3. Updated Documentation
**File**: `mobile/flutter/android/ANDROID_ICON_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Clarified the proper layer separation for adaptive icons and Material You theming support.

### How It Works Now

The icon system now properly follows Android adaptive icon best practices:

1. **Background Layer** (`ic_launcher_background.xml`): Provides a white solid background
2. **Foreground Layer** (`ic_launcher_foreground.xml`): Contains only the black Internet Archive building icon
3. **Monochrome Layer** (references foreground): Enables Android 13+ to recolor the icon to match the user's theme

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Icon now displays the Internet Archive building correctly (no longer pure white)
- ✅ Adaptive icon masks work properly (circular, rounded square, etc.)
- ✅ Material You theming on Android 13+ can recolor the icon to match system theme
- ✅ Proper contrast between icon and background on all Android devices
- ✅ Follows Android design guidelines for adaptive icons

### Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix:

1. **Build the app**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile/flutter
   flutter build apk --flavor production
   ```

2. **Install on device**:
   ```bash
   flutter install
   ```

3. **Verify icon appearance**:
   - Check app icon in launcher (should show black building on white background)
   - Long-press icon to see adaptive icon animation
   - On Android 13+, verify dynamic theming matches system theme
   - Test on multiple devices with different densities

### Visual Comparison

**Before Fix**:
- Icon appeared as a solid white square
- No visible building icon
- Material You theming didn't work

**After Fix**:
- Icon displays the Internet Archive building (black on white)
- Adaptive icon works with different launcher shapes
- Material You theming recolors the icon appropriately on Android 13+

## Summary

Both reported issues have been addressed:

1. **Search crashes**: Comprehensively fixed through FFI memory safety improvements, error handling, and retry logic
2. **Icon issues**: Fixed by removing the white background from the foreground layer, enabling proper adaptive icon behavior and Material You theming

The fixes ensure:
- Stable search functionality with graceful error handling
- Properly displayed app icon following Android design guidelines
- Material You theming support for modern Android devices
- Maintainable code with updated documentation and scripts
