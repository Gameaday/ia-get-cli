# Testing APK Build Fix

## Problem Statement
Development builds were not creating APK files because the build scripts and CI workflows expected APK files at hardcoded paths, but Flutter with flavors outputs to different locations.

## Root Cause
When building with `flutter build apk --flavor development`:
- Flutter outputs to: `build/app/outputs/apk/development/release/app-development-release.apk`
- But scripts expected: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-development-release.apk`

## Changes Made

### 1. scripts/build-mobile.sh
- **Lines 203-238**: Added flexible APK path detection
  - Now checks 3 possible paths for APK files
  - Provides detailed error messages showing all searched paths
  - Lists actual files found when expected path fails

- **Lines 165-198**: Added flexible App Bundle path detection
  - Now checks 2 possible paths for AAB files
  - Same error handling improvements

### 2. .github/workflows/ci.yml
- **Lines 478-540**: Updated artifact packaging
  - Checks multiple APK paths: `flutter-apk/*.apk`, `apk/*/release/*.apk`, `apk/*/*.apk`
  - Checks multiple AAB paths: `bundle/*/*.aab`, `bundle/*/*/*.aab`
  - Better error reporting with path listing

### 3. .github/workflows/release.yml
- **Lines 83-174**: Updated release artifact packaging
  - Same multi-path approach as CI workflow
  - Ensures production builds work correctly

## Expected Flutter Output Paths

### Without Flavors (Production)
- APK: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- AAB: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### With Flavors (Development/Staging)
- APK: `build/app/outputs/apk/{flavor}/release/app-{flavor}-release.apk`
- AAB: `build/app/outputs/bundle/{flavor}Release/app-{flavor}-release.aab`

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing (Requires Flutter)
```bash
# Test development APK build
./scripts/build-mobile.sh --development

# Test development App Bundle build
./scripts/build-mobile.sh --development --appbundle

# Test production builds
./scripts/build-mobile.sh --production
./scripts/build-mobile.sh --production --appbundle
```

### What to Verify
1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ Script reports correct output path
3. ✅ APK/AAB file exists at reported path
4. ✅ File size is reasonable (> 1MB)
5. ✅ No "output file not found" errors

### CI Testing
The fix will be tested automatically when:
1. Code is pushed to main branch
2. CI workflow runs Flutter mobile build job
3. Artifacts are packaged and uploaded

### Expected CI Output
Look for these messages in CI logs:
```
✓ Found APK files at: mobile/flutter/build/app/outputs/apk/development/release/*.apk
✓ Copied 1 APK file(s)
✓ Created Pure Dart Flutter app: flutter-mobile-dev.zip
```

## Fallback Behavior
If the expected paths still don't match:
- Script will try all defined paths
- Error message will show:
  - All searched paths
  - Actual APK/AAB files found via `find` command
- This helps diagnose any remaining path issues

## Migration Notes
- No breaking changes for existing builds
- Production builds continue to work as before
- Development and staging builds now work correctly
- Better error messages help diagnose future issues
