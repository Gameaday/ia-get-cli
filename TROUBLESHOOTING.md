# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps resolve common build and dependency issues in the ia-get project.

## Flutter/Dart SDK Version Issues

### Problem: "The current Dart SDK version is X.X.X. Because internet_archive_helper requires SDK version >=3.8.0"

**Root Cause**: Your local Flutter installation has an older Dart SDK version than required.

**Quick Fix**:

```bash
# Update Flutter to the latest stable version
flutter upgrade

# Verify you have Dart 3.8.0 or higher
flutter --version

# Expected output should show:
# Flutter 3.27.1 or higher
# Dart 3.8.0 or higher
```

**Complete Resolution Steps**:

1. **Update Flutter**:
   ```bash
   flutter upgrade
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Clean Flutter cache**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile/flutter
   flutter clean
   rm -rf pubspec.lock
   ```

3. **Get dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Verify the build**:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```

### Why This Issue Occurs

The project uses `flutter_lints: ^6.0.0` which requires Dart SDK ^3.8.0. This version comes with:
- Flutter 3.27.1 → Dart 3.8.0+
- Flutter 3.24.5 → Dart 3.5.4 (too old)
- Flutter 3.16.0 → Dart 3.2.x (too old)

## Rust Build Issues

### Problem: "Rust build fails" or "cargo build errors"

**Quick Fix**:

```bash
# Ensure you have the latest Rust toolchain
rustup update stable

# Format the code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy to check for issues
cargo clippy --no-default-features --features cli -- -D warnings

# Build the CLI version
cargo build --no-default-features --features cli
```

### Problem: "Cross-compilation for Android fails"

**Quick Fix**:

1. **Install Android targets**:
   ```bash
   rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
   rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi
   rustup target add x86_64-linux-android
   rustup target add i686-linux-android
   ```

2. **Install cargo-ndk**:
   ```bash
   cargo install cargo-ndk
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
   export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/26.1.10909125
   ```

4. **Build Android libraries**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-mobile.sh --development
   ```

## Dependency Issues

### Problem: "Package resolution failed" or "Version conflict"

**Quick Fix**:

```bash
# For Rust dependencies
cd /path/to/ia-get-cli
cargo clean
rm -rf Cargo.lock
cargo update
cargo build

# For Flutter dependencies  
cd mobile/flutter
flutter clean
rm -rf pubspec.lock
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Issues

### Problem: "GitHub Actions workflow fails"

**Note**: The repository's CI/CD configuration is already correct. If workflows are failing, it's likely due to:
- Cached dependencies from before the fix
- External service issues
- Unrelated build problems

**Check These Items**:

1. **Verify Flutter version in workflows** (should already be correct):
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` should have `flutter-version: '3.27.1'` ✓
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml` should have `flutter-version: '3.27.1'` ✓

2. **Verify Dart SDK constraint in pubspec.yaml** (should already be correct):
   ```yaml
   environment:
     sdk: '>=3.8.0 <4.0.0'  ✓
   ```

3. **Clear GitHub Actions cache**:
   - Go to your repository's Actions tab
   - Click on "Caches" in the left sidebar
   - Delete old caches if they exist

4. **Re-run the workflow**:
   - Sometimes a simple re-run after cache cleanup resolves issues

**Important**: The configuration files in this repository are already set to use the correct versions. If you're still seeing errors, they're likely due to cached dependencies or local environment issues, not the repository configuration.

## Environment Setup

### Recommended Versions

- **Rust**: 1.75.0 or higher (latest stable recommended)
- **Flutter**: 3.27.1 or higher
- **Dart**: 3.8.0 or higher (included with Flutter 3.27.1+)
- **Android SDK**: API 33 or higher
- **Android NDK**: 26.1.10909125 or compatible version
- **Java**: JDK 17 (for Android builds)

### Quick Environment Check

Run this command to check your environment:

```bash
# Check Rust
cargo --version
rustc --version

# Check Flutter (if building mobile)
flutter --version
flutter doctor

# Check Android (if building mobile)
echo $ANDROID_HOME
echo $ANDROID_NDK_HOME
```
