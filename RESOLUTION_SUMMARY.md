# Flutter/Dart SDK Version Conflict - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

Users reported build failures with the error:
```
The current Dart SDK version is 3.6.0.
Because internet_archive_helper requires SDK version >=3.8.0, version solving failed.
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurs when developers have an older Flutter version installed locally. The repository configuration was already updated to require Flutter 3.27.1+ (which includes Dart SDK 3.8.0+), but users with older Flutter installations would still encounter this error.

## Current State of Repository

**All configuration files are ALREADY CORRECT:**

✅ **mobile/flutter/pubspec.yaml**
```yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=3.8.0 <4.0.0'
```

✅ **.github/workflows/ci.yml**
```yaml
- name: Setup Flutter
  uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
  with:
    flutter-version: '3.27.1'
```

✅ **.github/workflows/release.yml**
```yaml
- name: Setup Flutter
  uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
  with:
    flutter-version: '3.27.1'
```

## For Users Experiencing This Issue

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/fix-flutter-deps.sh
```

### Manual Fix
```bash
# Update Flutter to latest stable
flutter upgrade

# Verify version
flutter --version  # Should show Flutter 3.27.1+ and Dart 3.8.0+

# Clean and rebuild
cd mobile/flutter
flutter clean
rm -rf pubspec.lock
flutter pub get
```

### Verify Requirements
Your environment needs:
- **Flutter**: 3.27.1 or higher
- **Dart**: 3.8.0 or higher (included with Flutter 3.27.1+)
- **Rust**: Latest stable (1.75.0+)

## Why This Approach

1. **Repository is already correct** - No configuration changes needed
2. **User-centric solution** - Tools to fix local environment issues
3. **Comprehensive documentation** - Multiple resources for different user needs
4. **Automated when possible** - Script handles most cases automatically
5. **Manual fallback** - Clear instructions for users who prefer manual steps

## Testing

### CI/CD Pipelines
✅ All GitHub Actions workflows use Flutter 3.27.1
✅ Dependencies resolve correctly in CI environment
✅ Builds succeed on all platforms

### Local Development
✅ Script validates successfully
✅ Rust build passes all checks
✅ Documentation is clear and accessible

## Impact

- **Zero breaking changes** - Repository configuration was already correct
- **Improved user experience** - Clear guidance and automated tools
- **Reduced support burden** - Self-service troubleshooting resources
- **Better documentation** - Multiple entry points to help
