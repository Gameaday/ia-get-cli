# Phase 1 Complete: Local Signing Setup ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ All local setup complete and tested

## Achievements

### 1. Self-Signed Code Signing Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- Created `.secrets/` folder with local signing credentials
- PFX certificate, base64 cert, and password stored securely
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Created `scripts/local-sign.ps1` for local executable signing
- Tested and verified: Signature applied with DigiCert timestamp

**Test Results**:
```
‚úì Certificate: CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source
‚úì Thumbprint: D59AC40C8B48E56E677241EB7A7E226AE6A9EC37
‚úì Timestamp: DigiCert SHA256 RSA4096 Timestamp Responder 2025 1
‚úì Status: UnknownError (expected - self-signed, not in Windows trust store)
```

### 2. Java Environment Configuration ‚úÖ
- Identified Java version conflict (system: Java 25, Flutter needs: Java 21)
- Created `scripts/setup-flutter-env.ps1` for Java 21 environment
- Updated `mobile/flutter/android/gradle.properties` with Java 21 path
- Verified Gradle uses Java 21 for both Launcher and Daemon JVMs

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow ‚úÖ
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` updated with self-signed PowerShell signing
- Removed all Azure Trusted Signing references
- Signing step decodes `CODE_SIGNING_CERT` and `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD` secrets
- Verification step validates signature after signing

### 4. Documentation ‚úÖ
- `docs/LOCAL_SIGNING_COMPLETE.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick command reference
- `docs/VSCODE_SNAPSHOT_ISSUE.md` - Troubleshooting VS Code cache issues
- `.secrets/README.md` - Security guidelines

### 5. Helper Scripts ‚úÖ
- `scripts/local-sign.ps1` - Sign Windows executables locally
- `scripts/setup-flutter-env.ps1` - Configure Java 21 environment
- `scripts/show-github-secrets.ps1` - Display GitHub secret values

### 6. Git Commits ‚úÖ

## Security Status ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ All secrets in `.secrets/` folder (gitignored)
- ‚úÖ Certificate files excluded from git (*.pfx, *cert-base64.txt)
- ‚úÖ Working tree clean, no secrets in commits
- ‚úÖ Desktop backups safe to delete after verification

## VS Code Problems - Resolved ‚úÖ

**Initial**: 25+ problems (mostly Azure-related)  
**Current**: 2 Java/Gradle warnings (cached, actual config fixed)  
**Resolution**: VS Code snapshot/cache issues; actual files correct

## Local Testing ‚úÖ

**Build**: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` ‚úÖ  
**Sign**: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\local-sign.ps1` ‚úÖ  
**Verify**: Signature applied correctly with timestamp ‚úÖ

# Phase 2: GitHub Actions CI Setup üöÄ

## Objective
Set up GitHub repository secrets and test the CI/CD signing workflow in GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites ‚úÖ
- Self-signed certificate created and tested locally
- Secrets prepared in `.secrets/` folder
- GitHub Actions workflow ready with self-signed signing steps

## Steps

### 1. Add GitHub Repository Secrets

**View secret values**:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\show-github-secrets.ps1
```

**Add to GitHub**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-get-cli/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add two secrets:
   - `CODE_SIGNING_CERT` - Copy entire base64 string from script output
   - `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD` - Copy password from script output

### 2. Test CI Signing with Test Tag

**Create and push a test tag**:
```bash
git tag v2.0.1-test
git push origin v2.0.1-test
```

**Or create from existing commit**:
```bash
git tag v2.0.1-test HEAD
git push origin v2.0.1-test
```

### 3. Monitor GitHub Actions Run

1. Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-get-cli/actions
2. Watch the "Build üèóÔ∏è and Publish üì¶Ô∏è" workflow
3. Check the "Sign Windows executable (Self-Signed)" step output
4. Verify "Verify Windows code signature" step passes

### 4. Verify Release Artifact

1. Download the Windows release artifact: `ia-get-v2.0.1-test-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`
2. Extract and check signature locally:
```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\ia-get.exe | Format-List *
```

### 5. Expected Results

**Sign step should show**:
- ‚úÖ Certificate imported: CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source
- ‚úÖ Successfully signed executable
- ‚úÖ Thumbprint: D59AC40C8B48E56E677241EB7A7E226AE6A9EC37

**Verify step should show**:
- Status: UnknownError or NotSigned (acceptable for self-signed)
- Subject: CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source
- Timestamp certificate from DigiCert

**Downloaded artifact**:
- Signature status: UnknownError (normal for self-signed)
- Signature present with timestamp

## Troubleshooting

### If secrets are not found in workflow
- Verify secret names are exact: `CODE_SIGNING_CERT` and `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD`
- Check secrets are added to repository (not environment)
- Ensure no leading/trailing spaces in secret values

### If signing fails
- Check certificate base64 is complete (no truncation)
- Verify password is correct
- Review workflow logs for specific error messages

### If signature verification shows "NotSigned"
- This can happen if signing step failed silently
- Check the sign step output for errors
- Verify certificate was imported successfully

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

- [ ] GitHub secrets added successfully
- [ ] Test tag pushed to repository
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
- [ ] Sign step shows successful certificate import and signing
- [ ] Verify step confirms signature is present
- [ ] Downloaded Windows executable has valid signature with timestamp
- [ ] Release artifacts published to GitHub releases

## Next Steps After Phase 2

Once CI signing is verified:

1. **Production Release**: Create actual version tag (e.g., `v2.0.1`)
2. **User Documentation**: Update README with Windows SmartScreen bypass instructions
3. **Certificate Trust**: Document that users will see "Unknown Publisher" warning
4. **Future Improvements**: Consider code signing certificate from CA if budget allows

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Phase 2
**Action Required**: Add GitHub secrets and push test tag
