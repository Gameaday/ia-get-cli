# Similar FFI Import Errors - Complete Fix

## Overview
After fixing the primary FFI symbol lookup error in `mobile/rust-ffi/src/lib.rs`, a comprehensive scan of the codebase identified one additional location with the same issue.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ JNI Bridge Import Path (Fixed)
**File**: `mobile/rust-ffi/src/jni_bridge.rs`  
**Line**: 15

**Before**:
```rust
use ia_get::interface::ffi::*;
```

**After**:
```rust
use ia_get::interface::ffi_simple::*;
```

**Status**: The JNI bridge is legacy code that references old FFI functions (14+ functions) that no longer exist. It's conditionally compiled only for Android targets and is not currently used by the Flutter app (which uses Dart FFI directly via isolates). The module has been:
- Updated to import from the correct `ffi_simple` module
- Marked with deprecation warnings
- Documented as needing rewrite or removal if JNI integration is required in the future

### 2. ✅ Documentation Update (Fixed)
**File**: `mobile/FFI_SYMBOL_FIX.md`

Updated the "Note on JNI Bridge" section to clarify:
- The JNI bridge has been updated to import from the correct module
- It still references non-existent old FFI functions
- It's legacy code not currently in use
- It needs to be rewritten or removed for future use

## Verification

### Build Success
```bash
$ cd mobile/rust-ffi && cargo build
   Compiling ia_get_mobile v1.6.0
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.09s
```

### No Remaining Issues
```bash
$ grep -r "ia_get::interface::ffi[^_]" --include="*.rs" --exclude-dir=target
mobile/FFI_SYMBOL_FIX.md:pub use ia_get::interface::ffi::*;  # Only in "before" example
```

All code references have been updated. The only remaining reference is in documentation showing the "before" state, which is intentional.

## Summary of All FFI Module References

### Active Code (Correct)
- ✅ `mobile/rust-ffi/src/lib.rs` - Uses `ia_get::interface::ffi_simple::*`
- ✅ `mobile/rust-ffi/src/jni_bridge.rs` - Uses `ia_get::interface::ffi_simple::*` (but module deprecated)
- ✅ `src/interface/mod.rs` - Exports `ffi_simple` module
- ✅ `src/interface/ffi_simple.rs` - Implements simplified FFI

### Documentation (Intentional)
- ✅ `docs/MIGRATION_TO_SIMPLIFIED_FFI.md` - Shows old vs new for migration guide
- ✅ `mobile/FFI_SYMBOL_FIX.md` - Shows "before" example
- ✅ `mobile/ANDROID_FFI_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md` - Historical reference to old interface

### Configuration (Correct)
- ✅ `cbindgen_simple.toml` - Configured for simplified FFI
- ✅ `Cargo.toml` - `ffi` feature enables `ffi_simple` module

## Impact

All instances of the incorrect FFI import path have been identified and corrected. The codebase now consistently uses `ia_get::interface::ffi_simple` for all active FFI imports.

### Remaining Work
The JNI bridge module should be either:
1. **Rewritten** to wrap the simplified FFI functions if JNI integration is needed
2. **Removed** entirely if it will never be used (current Flutter app doesn't use it)

This is a non-urgent cleanup task since the module is conditionally compiled and doesn't affect current functionality.
