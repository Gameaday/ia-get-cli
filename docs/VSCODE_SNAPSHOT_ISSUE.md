# VS Code Snapshot Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue
VS Code is displaying a stale "chat-editing-snapshot" file that shows old Azure signing code, even though the actual committed file has been updated with self-signed PowerShell implementation.

## Root Cause
The file you're viewing is:
```
chat-editing-snapshot-text-model:/c%3A/Project/ia-get-cli-github/ia-get-cli/.github/workflows/release.yml
```

This is a **temporary draft/snapshot** created by VS Code's chat/editing feature, NOT the actual file on disk.

## Verification - Actual File Status ✅

**Git status**: Clean working tree, no uncommitted changes
**Grep search**: No matches for "azure/trusted-signing" in release.yml
**Actual file content (lines 293-330)**: Contains self-signed PowerShell signing code

The actual `.github/workflows/release.yml` file has:
- ✅ Self-signed PowerShell signing step (lines 293-330)
- ✅ Self-signed verification step (lines 332-351)
- ❌ NO Azure Trusted Signing references

## Solution

### Option 1: Close the Snapshot File (Recommended)
1. Look at your VS Code tabs
2. Find the tab showing `release.yml` with a different icon (chat/snapshot indicator)
3. Close that tab
4. Open the real file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### Option 2: Reload VS Code Window
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "reload"
3. Select "Developer: Reload Window"
4. This will clear all cached snapshots

### Option 3: Discard Changes (if VS Code prompts)
1. If VS Code shows unsaved changes dialog
2. Click "Discard" (the snapshot, not your actual file)

## What Happened

The chat/editing system created a draft file when we were discussing changes. This draft still contains the old Azure code. However, the actual file was updated correctly and committed.

The error you see:
```
Unable to resolve action `azure/trusted-signing@v3`
```

...is only showing because you're viewing the snapshot, not the real file.

## Current Status ✅

- **Actual file**: Updated with self-signed code
- **Git status**: Committed and clean
- **Problem**: Only exists in VS Code's cached snapshot
- **Solution**: Close snapshot tab or reload VS Code

---

**Action Required**: Close the snapshot tab or reload VS Code window to view the actual committed file.
