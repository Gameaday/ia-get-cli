## How to Contribute

When implementing new features:

1. **Follow the Architecture**
   - Keep Rust stateless (computation only)
   - Manage state in Dart
   - Use simplified FFI for new features

2. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Write unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Test on real devices

3. **Document Changes**
   - Update README
   - Add inline documentation
   - Update user guides

4. **Performance First**
   - Profile before optimizing
   - Benchmark changes
   - Consider memory usage

## Conclusion

The ia-get project has a solid foundation with the simplified FFI architecture. The immediate focus should be on:

1. **Stability** - Testing and bug fixes
2. **Performance** - Optimization and efficiency
3. **UX** - Polish and refinement
4. **Features** - Gradual, user-driven additions

The architecture is now flexible enough to support all these enhancements without major rewrites!
