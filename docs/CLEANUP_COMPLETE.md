# Repository Cleanup Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: All Azure references removed, ready for testing

## Files Removed

### 1. ‚úÖ `docs/AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_SETUP.md`
- Old Azure setup documentation
- Removed earlier in the session

### 2. ‚úÖ `docs/WINDOWS_CODE_SIGNING.md`
- Outdated documentation with Azure Trusted Signing info
- **Just removed**
- Replaced by: `docs/SELF_SIGNED_SETUP.md`

### 3. ‚úÖ `CERTIFICATE_INFO.txt`
- Temporary file with certificate password
- Security risk (contained plaintext password)
- **Just removed**

## Verification Results

### ‚úÖ Workflows Clean
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Only self-signed implementation
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - No signing references (as expected)
- **Zero Azure references found**

### ‚úÖ Documentation Clean
Remaining signing documentation:
- `docs/SELF_SIGNED_SETUP.md` - Complete self-signing guide ‚úÖ
- `docs/SELF_SIGNED_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This implementation summary ‚úÖ
- `docs/FREE_CODE_SIGNING.md` - Overview of alternatives ‚úÖ
- `docs/PROBLEMS_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Issue tracking ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current VS Code Problems: 4 Total

**Expected Warnings (2):**
1. Line 297: `Context access might be invalid: CODE_SIGNING_CERT`
2. Line 302: `Context access might be invalid: CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD`
   - **Status**: Normal until secrets are added to GitHub
   - **Will resolve**: After adding secrets and testing

**Postponed Errors (2):**
1. `mobile/flutter/android/app/build.gradle` - Java version mismatch
2. `mobile/flutter/android/build.gradle` - Java version mismatch
   - **Status**: Postponed per user decision
   - **Reason**: System using Java 25, needs Java 21/17

## What's Left to Clean Up

### üîê Security Cleanup (After Testing)
Once signing is verified working:
1. Delete: `C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\ia-get-codesign.pfx`
2. Delete: `C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\cert-base64.txt`
3. Save certificate to secure backup location
4. Save password to password manager
5. Delete this cleanup document

## Ready for Testing ‚úÖ

The repository is now clean and ready to test the self-signed certificate implementation:

```bash
# Test the signing workflow
git add -A
git commit -m "Clean up Azure references and prepare for self-signed testing"
git push origin main
git tag v1.0.0-signing-test
git push origin v1.0.0-signing-test
```

### Expected Test Results:
1. ‚úÖ Workflow runs successfully
2. ‚úÖ "Sign Windows executable (Self-Signed)" step succeeds
3. ‚úÖ "Verify Windows code signature" step shows valid signature
4. ‚úÖ Release artifact contains signed `ia-get.exe`
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è VS Code secret warnings remain until secrets verified in GitHub Actions

## Summary

**Before Cleanup:**
- 10 VS Code errors
- Azure documentation scattered
- Temporary sensitive files

**After Cleanup:**
- 4 VS Code problems (2 expected, 2 postponed)
- Zero Azure references
- Clean, production-ready codebase
- Ready for testing

**Next Action**: Test the signing with a release tag!
