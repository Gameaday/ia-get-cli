# Self-Signed Code Signing Setup Guide

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - Self-signed certificate implementation  
**Cost**: FREE (no recurring charges)

## üìã Overview

This project uses **self-signed certificates** to digitally sign Windows executables. While self-signed certificates still trigger SmartScreen warnings (same as unsigned), they provide:

- ‚úÖ **Consistent identity** across releases
- ‚úÖ **Tamper detection** - signatures break if files are modified
- ‚úÖ **Zero cost** - completely free
- ‚úÖ **Full control** - you own the certificate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### What Self-Signing Does:
- ‚úÖ Proves the file hasn't been tampered with
- ‚úÖ Provides consistent publisher identity
- ‚úÖ Shows your name in signature properties
- ‚úÖ Free forever

### What Self-Signing Does NOT Do:
- ‚ùå Does NOT eliminate SmartScreen warnings
- ‚ùå Does NOT build Windows reputation automatically
- ‚ùå Does NOT work like commercial certificates

**Users will still see**: "Windows protected your PC" warning and must click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Generate Self-Signed Certificate

Run this in PowerShell **as Administrator**:

```powershell
# Create a self-signed code signing certificate
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate `
    -Type CodeSigningCert `
    -Subject "CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source" `
    -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
    -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(10) `
    -KeyLength 2048

Write-Host "‚úÖ Certificate created:"
Write-Host "   Subject: $($cert.Subject)"
Write-Host "   Thumbprint: $($cert.Thumbprint)"
Write-Host "   Expires: $($cert.NotAfter)"

# Export the certificate with a password
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YourSecurePassword123!" -Force -AsPlainText
$certPath = "$HOME\Desktop\ia-get-codesign.pfx"
Export-PfxCertificate -Cert $cert -FilePath $certPath -Password $password

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "‚úÖ Certificate exported to: $certPath"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: Save this certificate and password securely!"
Write-Host "   You'll need them to sign future releases."
```

**Important**: 
- Choose a strong password and **save it securely**
- Keep the `.pfx` file in a safe location
- You'll need both for GitHub Secrets

### Step 2: Encode Certificate for GitHub

```powershell
# Base64 encode the certificate
$certBytes = [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("$HOME\Desktop\ia-get-codesign.pfx")
$certBase64 = [Convert]::ToBase64String($certBytes)

# Copy to clipboard
$certBase64 | Set-Clipboard

Write-Host "‚úÖ Certificate encoded and copied to clipboard"
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Next steps:"
Write-Host "1. Go to GitHub Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions"
Write-Host "2. Click 'New repository secret'"
Write-Host "3. Name: CODE_SIGNING_CERT"
Write-Host "4. Value: Paste from clipboard (Ctrl+V)"
Write-Host "5. Click 'Add secret'"
```

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository on GitHub:

1. **Navigate to**: `https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-get-cli/settings/secrets/actions`

2. **Add first secret**:
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `CODE_SIGNING_CERT`
   - Value: Paste the base64-encoded certificate (from clipboard)
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Add second secret**:
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD`
   - Value: The password you used (e.g., `YourSecurePassword123!`)
   - Click "Add secret"

### Step 4: Test the Setup

Create a test release to verify signing works:

```bash
# Create and push a test tag
git tag v1.0.0-signing-test
git push origin v1.0.0-signing-test
```

Then:
1. Go to Actions tab on GitHub
2. Wait for the workflow to complete
3. Check the "Sign Windows executable" step - should show ‚úÖ
4. Download the release artifact
5. Right-click the `.exe` ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Digital Signatures tab
6. You should see your certificate!

## üîç Verifying Signatures

### On Windows:

**Method 1: File Properties**
1. Right-click `ia-get.exe` ‚Üí Properties
2. Go to "Digital Signatures" tab
3. Select signature ‚Üí Click "Details"
4. Should show your certificate subject

**Method 2: PowerShell**
```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature ia-get.exe | Format-List *
```

**Method 3: signtool (Windows SDK)**
```cmd
signtool verify /pa ia-get.exe
```

### Expected Output:
```
Status: Valid
Subject: CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source
Issuer: CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source (self-issued)
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### 1. Secure Certificate Storage

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Store the `.pfx` file in encrypted storage
- ‚úÖ Use a password manager for the password
- ‚úÖ Keep backups in multiple secure locations
- ‚úÖ Limit access to the certificate

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Commit the `.pfx` file to Git
- ‚ùå Share the certificate password via email/chat
- ‚ùå Store password in plain text files
- ‚ùå Use weak passwords

### 2. Certificate Lifecycle

**Validity**: Certificate is valid for 10 years

**When to renew**:
- Before expiration (check with PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\My`)
- If certificate is compromised
- If you want to change identity information

**Renewal process**:
1. Generate new certificate (same steps as above)
2. Update GitHub Secrets
3. Old releases will still show old certificate (this is normal)

### 3. Private Key Protection

The `.pfx` file contains your **private key**. If someone gets:
- ‚úÖ Just the `.pfx` file: They still need the password
- ‚úÖ Just the password: They still need the `.pfx` file
- ‚ùå Both `.pfx` + password: They can sign files as you!

**If compromised**:
1. Generate a new certificate immediately
2. Update GitHub Secrets
3. Consider informing users about the old certificate

## üìù Certificate Information

Use this information when creating your certificate:

| Field | Recommended Value | Example |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| Subject (CN) | Project name | `ia-get Project` |
| Organization (O) | Organization type | `Open Source` |
| Validity | 5-10 years | 10 years |
| Key Length | 2048 or 4096 bits | 2048 bits |
| Type | Code Signing | CodeSigningCert |

## üéØ What Users Will See

### First Download:
1. SmartScreen warning: "Windows protected your PC"
2. Must click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"
3. File properties show your certificate

### After Running Once:
- Windows remembers the executable
- May still show warning for new versions
- Signature remains verifiable

### In Windows Explorer:
- Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Digital Signatures
- Shows your certificate information
- Can verify signature validity

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Certificate not found" in GitHub Actions

**Cause**: Secrets not set correctly

**Solution**:
1. Verify both secrets exist: `CODE_SIGNING_CERT` and `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD`
2. Check base64 encoding was done correctly
3. Ensure no extra spaces/newlines in secret values

### Issue: "Cannot import PFX file"

**Cause**: Wrong password or corrupted file

**Solution**:
1. Test locally first: `Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath cert.pfx -Password $password`
2. Verify password matches exactly
3. Re-export certificate if needed

### Issue: "Signature shows as invalid"

**Cause**: Self-signed certificates appear as "unknown publisher"

**Solution**:
- This is **normal** for self-signed certificates
- Signature is still cryptographically valid
- Users must manually trust on first run

### Issue: "Timestamping failed"

**Cause**: Timestamp server unreachable

**Solution**:
- Workflow will retry automatically
- DigiCert timestamp server is reliable
- Can try alternative: `http://timestamp.sectigo.com`

## üìä Workflow Integration

The signing process is automated in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Sign Windows executable (Self-Signed)
  if: matrix.job.target == 'x86_64-pc-windows-msvc' && matrix.job.os == 'windows-latest'
  shell: powershell
  run: |
    # Decode certificate, sign executable, verify signature
    # See release.yml for full implementation
```

**What it does**:
1. Decodes certificate from GitHub Secret
2. Imports certificate to Windows certificate store
3. Signs `ia-get.exe` with timestamp
4. Verifies signature
5. Cleans up certificate from store
6. Shows signing status

## üÜö Comparison with Other Methods

| Feature | Self-Signed | SignPath.io | Azure | No Signing |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|
| Cost | Free | Free (OSS) | $10/mo | Free |
| Setup Time | 5 min | 1-2 days | 1 hour | 0 min |
| SmartScreen | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning | ‚úÖ Reduced | ‚úÖ Reduced | ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning |
| Reputation | Low | Builds | Builds | None |
| Control | Full | Limited | Limited | N/A |
| Maintenance | Minimal | None | Minimal | None |

## üîÑ Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Verify signature | Each release | Automatic in workflow |
| Check expiration | Yearly | Certificate valid 10 years |
| Backup certificate | Once | Keep in secure location |
| Update password | Never* | Unless compromised |
| Rotate certificate | Every 5-10 years | Or if compromised |

*Password should be strong from the start
