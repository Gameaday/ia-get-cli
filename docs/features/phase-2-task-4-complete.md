## 🔧 Technical Details

### Share Text Implementation
```dart
Future<void> _shareText(FilePreview preview) async {
  if (preview.textContent == null || preview.textContent!.isEmpty) {
    _showShareError('No text content to share');
    return;
  }

  await Share.share(
    preview.textContent!,
    subject: preview.fileName,  // Shows filename in share dialog
  );
}
```

### Share Image Implementation
```dart
Future<void> _shareImage(FilePreview preview) async {
  if (preview.previewData == null || preview.previewData!.isEmpty) {
    _showShareError('No image data to share');
    return;
  }

  // Create XFile from bytes (in-memory file)
  final xFile = XFile.fromData(
    preview.previewData!,
    name: preview.fileName,
    mimeType: 'image/jpeg',
  );

  await Share.shareXFiles(
    [xFile],
    subject: preview.fileName,
  );
}
```

### Error Display
```dart
void _showShareError(String message) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text(message),
      backgroundColor: Colors.orange.shade700,  // Warning color
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 3),
    ),
  );
}
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Audio/Video**: Not supported (Phase 3 feature)

4. **Markdown**: Shares as plain text (not formatted)

### These Are Expected
- Audio/video preview comes in Phase 3
- PDF preview would enable PDF sharing
- Original file sharing requires download first
- Markdown formatting is a nice-to-have enhancement

### Future Enhancements
