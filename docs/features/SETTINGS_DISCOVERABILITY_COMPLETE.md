# Settings Discoverability Implementation - Complete

## Issue #5: New Settings Not Discoverable ⚠️ MEDIUM - ✅ FIXED

### Implementation Date
October 7, 2025

### Summary
Successfully implemented feature discoverability for Internet Archive Helper v1.6.0. Created a What's New dialog that shows once per version to highlight new features, and added bandwidth controls section to Settings for better navigation.

---

## Problem Statement

**Issue:** New features added without discoverability mechanisms:
- Users unaware of bandwidth controls
- Download progress improvements not communicated
- File opening capability not highlighted
- Deep link support invisible to users

**Impact:** Users miss valuable features, reducing app satisfaction and perceived value.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. What's New Dialog

#### Features
- **Version-aware**: Shows once per app version update
- **Beautiful UI**: Material Design with colored icons and containers
- **Non-blocking**: Appears 500ms after home screen loads
- **User-friendly**: Single "Got it!" button to dismiss
- **Persistent tracking**: Uses SharedPreferences to remember shown versions

#### Content Highlights
1. **Real-Time Progress** - Live speed and time remaining
2. **Open Downloaded Files** - Tap files to open instantly
3. **Deep Links** - Click archive.org links anywhere
4. **Bandwidth Controls** - Limit download speed

#### Technical Implementation
```dart
class WhatsNewDialog extends StatelessWidget {
  static const String targetVersion = '1.6.0';
  static const String _prefKey = 'whats_new_last_shown_version';

  static Future<bool> shouldShow() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    final lastShownVersion = prefs.getString(_prefKey);
    return lastShownVersion != targetVersion;
  }

  static Future<void> markAsShown() async {
    final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
    await prefs.setString(_prefKey, targetVersion);
  }
  
  // ... dialog UI implementation
}
```

#### Integration Point
Added to `_AppInitializerState._initializeCriticalServices()`:
```dart
Future<void> _showWhatsNewIfNeeded() async {
  final shouldShow = await WhatsNewDialog.shouldShow();
  
  if (shouldShow && mounted) {
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    
    if (mounted) {
      showDialog(
        context: context,
        barrierDismissible: false,
        builder: (context) => const WhatsNewDialog(),
      );
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Settings Screen Enhancement

#### Bandwidth & Speed Section
Added new section between "Download Settings" and "File Browser":

```dart
_buildSectionHeader('Bandwidth & Speed'),

ListTile(
  leading: const Icon(Icons.speed),
  title: Row(
    children: [
      const Text('Bandwidth Limit'),
      const SizedBox(width: 8),
      Tooltip(
        message: 'Control download speed to save data and be a good citizen',
        child: Icon(Icons.info_outline, size: 16),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  subtitle: const Text('Configure speed limits on Downloads screen'),
  trailing: const Icon(Icons.arrow_forward),
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/downloads');
  },
),
```

**Features:**
- Clear icon (speed gauge)
- Tooltip explaining purpose
- Navigation to Downloads screen where controls live
- Explains location of actual controls

---

## User Experience Flow

### First Launch After Update
1. User opens app
2. App initializes services
3. Home screen loads
4. After 500ms delay, What's New dialog appears
5. User reads about new features
6. User taps "Got it!"
7. Dialog dismissed and never shown again for v1.6.0

### Settings Discovery
1. User opens Settings
2. Sees new "Bandwidth & Speed" section
3. Hovers over info icon → sees tooltip
4. Taps row → navigates to Downloads screen
5. Sees BandwidthControlsWidget with full controls

### Future Versions
To show What's New for v1.7.0:
1. Update `pubspec.yaml` version to `1.7.0`
2. Update `WhatsNewDialog.targetVersion` to `'1.7.0'`
3. Update dialog content with new features
4. Dialog automatically shows once for all users

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/widgets/whats_new_dialog.dart` (NEW - 180 lines)
**Purpose:** Feature announcement dialog

**Key Components:**
- `shouldShow()` - Version checking logic
- `markAsShown()` - Persistence management
- `_buildFeatureItem()` - Reusable feature row
- Material Design UI with colored icons

### 2. `lib/main.dart` (Modified)
**Changes:**
- Added import for `WhatsNewDialog`
- Added `_showWhatsNewIfNeeded()` method
- Called in `_initializeCriticalServices()`

**Lines Changed:** +30 lines

### 3. `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` (Modified)
**Changes:**
- Added "Bandwidth & Speed" section
- Created ListTile with tooltip and navigation
- Positioned between downloads and file browser sections

**Lines Changed:** +27 lines

---

## Technical Details

### Version Tracking
**Mechanism:** SharedPreferences key-value store

**Key:** `'whats_new_last_shown_version'`

**Values:**
- `null` - Never shown, show for current version
- `'1.5.0'` - Last shown for v1.5.0, show if current is v1.6.0
- `'1.6.0'` - Already shown for v1.6.0, don't show again

### Timing Strategy
**500ms delay** after home screen loads:
- Allows UI to settle
- Prevents jarring immediate popup
- Gives user moment to orient
- Still feels immediate to user

### Non-Blocking Design
All operations use `async/await` with proper error handling:
- Failed SharedPreferences read → don't show dialog
- Failed dialog show → log and continue
- No crashes or blocking on failures

### 3. Rapid App Restarts
**Issue:** User force-closes app during dialog  
**Handling:** Dialog not marked as shown until dismissed

### 4. Version Downgrade
**Issue:** User installs older version  
**Handling:** Compare strings, show if different

### 5. Missing Context
