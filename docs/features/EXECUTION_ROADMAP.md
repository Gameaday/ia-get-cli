## 💡 Principles

1. **No Feature Creep**: Stick to the plan, resist adding "just one more thing"
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer perfect features
3. **User-Centric**: Real user feedback drives decisions
4. **Ship Early, Iterate**: Get to market, learn, improve
5. **Sustainable Pace**: Marathon, not sprint - avoid burnout
