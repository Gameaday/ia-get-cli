# Local Code Signing Setup - Complete

## Summary
Successfully configured local code signing infrastructure for the ia-get project with proper security measures.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Local Secrets Management ✅
- Created `.secrets/` directory in project root
- Stored three files securely:
  - `CODE_SIGNING_CERT.txt` - Base64-encoded PFX certificate
  - `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD.txt` - Certificate password
  - `cert.pfx` - Binary certificate file
- Added `.secrets/` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Created `.secrets/README.md` with security guidelines

### 2. Code Signing Workflow ✅
- Updated `scripts/local-sign.ps1` to use project-local secrets
- Successfully tested signing workflow:
  - Built Windows release: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  - Signed executable: `ia-get.exe` with self-signed certificate
  - Verified signature: Certificate properly applied with DigiCert timestamp
  - Status: "UnknownError" is expected for self-signed certs (not trusted by Windows by default)

### 3. Java Environment for Flutter ✅
- Identified Java version conflict: System has Java 25, Flutter needs Java 21
- Created `scripts/setup-flutter-env.ps1` to configure Java 21 environment
- Updated `mobile/flutter/android/gradle.properties` with Java 21 path
- Verified Gradle now uses Java 21 for both Launcher and Daemon JVMs

## Signature Verification Results

```
SignerCertificate:     CN=ia-get Project, O=Open Source
Thumbprint:            D59AC40C8B48E56E677241EB7A7E226AE6A9EC37
TimeStamperCertificate: CN=DigiCert SHA256 RSA4096 Timestamp Responder 2025 1
Status:                UnknownError (expected - self-signed cert not trusted by Windows)
```

**Important**: The "UnknownError" status is normal for self-signed certificates. The signature IS properly applied and timestamped. The certificate just isn't in the Windows Trusted Root Certificate store.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.secrets/README.md` - Security documentation
- `.secrets/CODE_SIGNING_CERT.txt` - Base64 certificate (gitignored)
- `.secrets/CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD.txt` - Password (gitignored)
- `.secrets/cert.pfx` - Binary certificate (gitignored)
- `scripts/setup-flutter-env.ps1` - Java environment setup

### Modified Files
- `.gitignore` - Added `.secrets/` and related patterns
- `scripts/local-sign.ps1` - Updated to use project secrets
- `mobile/flutter/android/gradle.properties` - Configured Java 21 path

## How to Use

### Sign Windows Executable
```powershell
# Build release
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

# Sign executable
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\local-sign.ps1
```

### Build Flutter Android (with correct Java version)
```powershell
# Set up environment
. .\scripts\setup-flutter-env.ps1

# Build Flutter
cd mobile/flutter
flutter build apk --release
```

## Security Checklist ✅

- [x] Secrets stored in project-local `.secrets/` folder
- [x] `.secrets/` added to `.gitignore`
- [x] Additional security patterns added (*.pfx, *cert-base64.txt, CERTIFICATE_INFO.txt)
- [x] `.secrets/README.md` documents security practices
- [x] Original secrets on Desktop (can be safely deleted after confirmation)

## Remaining VS Code Errors

VS Code may still show 2 Gradle errors due to cached state:
```
mobile/flutter/android/app/build.gradle - Unsupported class file major version 68
mobile/flutter/android/build.gradle - Unsupported class file major version 68
```

**Resolution**: These are cached errors. The Java environment is now correctly configured.

**To clear cached errors**:
1. Run: `. .\scripts\setup-flutter-env.ps1` (already done)
2. Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Or restart VS Code

The Gradle daemons have been stopped and Java 21 is now configured. A VS Code reload will pick up the new configuration.

## Next Steps

1. **Verify VS Code errors are cleared**
   - Reload VS Code window to clear cached Gradle errors
   
2. **Test Flutter build** (optional)
   ```powershell
   . .\scripts\setup-flutter-env.ps1
   cd mobile/flutter
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions Setup** (when ready)
   - Add `CODE_SIGNING_CERT` secret (contents of `.secrets/CODE_SIGNING_CERT.txt`)
   - Add `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD` secret (contents of `.secrets/CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD.txt`)
   - Push a test tag to trigger release workflow
   - Verify CI signing works in GitHub Actions

## Security Notes

### Keep Secure
- `.secrets/` folder contents (already gitignored)
- Desktop backups: `C:\Users\Carl\Desktop\ia-get-codesign.pfx` and `cert-base64.txt`

### Can Delete (if desired)
- Desktop files after confirming `.secrets/` folder is working
- Never needed in version control

### Never Commit
- `.pfx` files
- Base64 certificate strings
- Passwords or password files
