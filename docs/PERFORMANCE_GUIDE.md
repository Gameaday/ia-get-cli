## Overview

ia-get includes extensive performance optimizations introduced in version 1.5.0 and continuously improved in subsequent releases. These optimizations focus on:

- Connection pooling and reuse
- Adaptive buffer management
- Intelligent timeout calculation
- Memory efficiency
- Download throughput optimization

## Performance Features

### 1. Connection Pooling

**What it does:** Maintains a pool of reusable HTTP connections to avoid connection establishment overhead.

**Configuration:**
- Default: 5 idle connections per host
- Pool idle timeout: 120 seconds
- Supports HTTP/2 for better multiplexing

**Benefits:**
- Up to 90% reduction in connection overhead
- Faster subsequent downloads from the same archive
- Reduced server load and better resource utilization

### 2. Adaptive Buffer Management

**What it does:** Dynamically adjusts buffer sizes based on file types and observed performance.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimum buffer: 8 KB (small files)
- Default buffer: 64 KB (medium files)
- Maximum buffer: 1 MB (large files)
- Adjusts based on performance feedback

**Benefits:**
- 20-50% improvement in large file downloads
- Optimized memory usage for different file sizes
- Automatic adaptation to network conditions

### 3. Intelligent Timeout Calculation

**What it does:** Calculates timeouts based on file size and network conditions.

**Configuration:**
- Base timeout: 60 seconds
- Maximum timeout: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Dynamic adjustment based on file size

**Benefits:**
- ~30% reduction in unnecessary timeouts
- Better handling of large file downloads
- Improved reliability on slower connections

### 4. Performance Monitoring

**What it does:** Collects real-time metrics about download performance.

**Metrics tracked:**
- Download speeds (average and peak)
- Connection statistics (established, reused, timeouts)
- Memory usage (current and peak)
- Success/failure rates
- Retry counts

**Access:** Metrics can be queried through the FFI interface for mobile apps or logged during CLI operations.

## Benchmarking

### Running Benchmarks

ia-get includes comprehensive benchmark suites using the Criterion framework:

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
cargo bench

# Run specific benchmark suite
cargo bench --bench download_performance
cargo bench --bench performance_benchmarks

# Run benchmarks with baseline comparison
cargo bench --bench download_performance --save-baseline main
# Make changes...
cargo bench --bench download_performance --baseline main
```

### Benchmark Output

Benchmarks generate:
- HTML reports in `target/criterion/`
- Performance comparisons between runs
- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
- Regression detection

### Key Benchmark Areas

1. **HTTP Client Creation** (`performance_benchmarks.rs`)
   - Default client initialization
   - Archive-optimized client
   - Metadata-optimized client
   - Connectivity test client

2. **Performance Monitoring** (`performance_benchmarks.rs`)
   - Monitor creation overhead
   - Download recording performance
   - Metrics retrieval speed
   - Report generation

3. **Download Operations** (`download_performance.rs`)
   - Concurrent downloader creation
   - Metadata processing
   - Size parsing operations
   - URL processing
   - Memory usage patterns

## Optimization Tips

### For CLI Users

1. **Use Appropriate Concurrency**
   ```bash
   # Default (4 concurrent downloads) - good for most cases
   ia-get get <identifier>
   
   # Higher concurrency for fast connections (8-16)
   ia-get get <identifier> --concurrent 16
   
   # Lower concurrency for slow/unreliable connections (1-2)
   ia-get get <identifier> --concurrent 2
   ```

2. **Enable Compression When Appropriate**
   - Automatic decompression is enabled by default
   - For archives with pre-compressed files, decompression adds overhead
   - Consider disabling auto-decompress for already-compressed content

3. **Filter Before Downloading**
   ```bash
   # Download only specific formats
   ia-get get <identifier> --format mp3,flac
   
   # Filter by size to avoid large files
   ia-get get <identifier> --max-size 100MB
   ```

4. **Use Resume Capability**
   - Interrupted downloads can be resumed
   - Saves bandwidth and time
   - Especially valuable for large files

### For Developers

1. **Minimize String Cloning**
   - Use string slices (`&str`) instead of `String` when possible
   - Pass references instead of cloning
   - Use `Arc<String>` for shared ownership

2. **Optimize Lock Contention**
   - Keep critical sections short
   - Consider using `tokio::sync::RwLock` for read-heavy workloads
   - Use message passing (`mpsc`) instead of shared state when feasible

3. **Leverage Async/Await**
   - Use `tokio::spawn` for concurrent operations
   - Avoid blocking operations in async contexts
   - Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for CPU-intensive work

4. **Buffer Management**
   ```rust
   // Use the adaptive buffer manager
   let buffer_manager = AdaptiveBufferManager::new();
   let buffer_size = buffer_manager.get_optimal_buffer_for_file_size(file_size);
   
   // Update performance feedback
   buffer_manager.update_performance(observed_speed);
   ```

5. **Performance Monitoring in Code**
   ```rust
   use ia_get::utilities::common::performance::PerformanceMonitor;
   
   let monitor = PerformanceMonitor::new();
   
   // Record a download
   monitor.record_download(bytes_downloaded, duration).await;
   
   // Get metrics
   let metrics = monitor.get_metrics().await;
   println!("Average speed: {:.2} MB/s", metrics.avg_speed / 1_048_576.0);
   
   // Generate report
   let report = monitor.generate_report().await;
   println!("{}", report);
   ```

## Monitoring Performance

### CLI Metrics

During downloads, ia-get displays:
- Real-time progress bars
- Current download speed
- Estimated time remaining
- Success/failure counts

### FFI/Mobile Metrics

Mobile applications can query performance metrics:

```dart
// Get performance metrics
final metrics = await iaGetService.getPerformanceMetrics();
print('Total requests: ${metrics['total_requests']}');
print('Success rate: ${metrics['success_rate']}%');
print('Cache hit rate: ${metrics['cache_hit_rate']}%');

// Check system health
final healthScore = iaGetService.checkHealth();
// 0 = healthy, higher values indicate issues

// Reset metrics for a new session
iaGetService.resetPerformanceMetrics();
```

### Profiling

For deep performance analysis:

1. **Using cargo flamegraph:**
   ```bash
   cargo install flamegraph
   cargo flamegraph --bin ia-get -- get <identifier>
   ```

2. **Using perf (Linux):**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   perf record --call-graph dwarf ./target/release/ia-get get <identifier>
   perf report
   ```

3. **Memory profiling with valgrind:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   valgrind --tool=massif ./target/release/ia-get get <identifier>
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Downloads

**Symptoms:** Lower than expected download speeds

**Solutions:**
1. Increase concurrent downloads: `--concurrent 16`
2. Check network conditions and Internet Archive server status
3. Verify connection pooling is working (check reuse rate in metrics)
4. Consider using HTTP/2 if not already enabled
5. Check for rate limiting from the server

### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:** Excessive RAM consumption

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce concurrent downloads: `--concurrent 2`
2. Check buffer sizes are appropriate for file sizes
3. Monitor peak memory usage in performance metrics
4. Consider downloading in smaller batches
5. Verify no memory leaks (run with valgrind)

### Timeout Issues

**Symptoms:** Frequent connection timeouts

**Solutions:**
1. Check network stability
2. Increase base timeout in configuration
3. Reduce concurrent downloads to lower bandwidth requirements
4. Monitor connection timeout count in metrics
5. Use retry mechanism (automatic in CLI)

### Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Symptoms:** Delays between downloads, low connection reuse rate

**Solutions:**
1. Increase pool idle timeout
2. Increase max idle connections per host
3. Reduce concurrent downloads if overwhelming the pool
4. Monitor connection establishment vs. reuse in metrics
