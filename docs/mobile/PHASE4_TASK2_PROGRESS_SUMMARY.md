## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical
- None

### High
- None

### Medium
- Unit tests need adjustment to match service APIs
- sqflite_common_ffi dependency needed for testing

### Low  
- Some packages have newer versions (flutter_markdown discontinued)
- Font tree-shaking disabled in CI (acceptable trade-off)

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Incremental Development**: Building models → services → UI worked perfectly
2. **MD3 Compliance**: Following guidelines from start prevented rework
3. **Build Optimizations**: Identifying root cause early saved hours
4. **Documentation**: Creating checklists and docs alongside code

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Build Duplication**: Fixed with `org.gradle.parallel=false`
2. **resValues Error**: Quick fix enabling required build feature
3. **Navigation Flow**: Type-safe routing with SearchQuery objects
4. **Date Picker**: Custom implementation with validation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Testing**: Should write tests alongside code, not after
2. **API Design**: Could mock AdvancedSearchService for faster iteration
3. **Documentation**: Could add more inline code comments
4. **Profiling**: Should profile performance earlier
