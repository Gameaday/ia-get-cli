# CI/CD & Release Infrastructure Update

## Overview
Restructured CI/CD workflows and created concise release documentation to clearly handle Rust and Flutter artifacts separately.

## Changes Made

### 1. New CI/CD Workflows

#### `rust-ci.yml` - Rust CLI & Server Pipeline
**Purpose:** Build and test Rust binaries for all desktop platforms

**Jobs:**
- ‚úÖ **test**: Format, clippy, unit tests (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- ‚úÖ **build**: Cross-compile for 6 platforms
  - Linux: x86_64 (glibc/musl), ARM64
  - Windows: x86_64 (code-signed ready)
  - macOS: Intel + Apple Silicon
- ‚úÖ **release**: Package and upload to GitHub releases

**Artifacts:**
- Native binaries: `.tar.gz` (Unix), `.zip` (Windows)
- SHA256 checksums for all files
- Size: ~7-9 MB per platform

**Optimizations:**
- Parallel builds across platforms
- Cargo caching for faster builds
- Strip binaries to reduce size
- Separate cache per target

---

#### `flutter-ci.yml` - Flutter Mobile & Web Pipeline
**Purpose:** Build Flutter app for Android and web platforms

**Jobs:**
- ‚úÖ **analyze**: Flutter analyze + tests
- ‚úÖ **build-android**: Universal APK (arm64, armv7, x86_64)
- ‚úÖ **build-web**: Web bundle for GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ **deploy-web**: Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages (main branch)
- ‚úÖ **release**: Upload artifacts to GitHub releases

**Artifacts:**
- Android: `app-release.apk` (~15 MB)
- Web: `web-bundle.tar.gz` (~3 MB)
- SHA256 checksums for all files

**Features:**
- Pure Dart - no native compilation
- Standard Flutter workflow
- Automatic web deployment
- GitHub Pages integration

---

### 2. Concise Downloads Page

Created `DOWNLOADS.md` with:

**Structure:**
1. **Flutter Mobile & Web** section
   - Android APK download links
   - Web app URL (try online)
   - Installation instructions
   - Features overview

2. **Rust CLI & Server** section
   - Quick install commands (curl one-liners)
   - Platform matrix with download links
   - File sizes and notes
   - Features overview

3. **Verification** section
   - SHA256 checksum instructions (Linux/macOS/Windows)
   - Copy-paste commands

4. **Version Information**
   - Current versions for each stack
   - Stable vs Development channels

5. **Troubleshooting**
   - Platform-specific issues (SmartScreen, Gatekeeper, etc.)
   - Quick fixes

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: Flutter vs Rust
- ‚úÖ Direct download links (no navigation)
- ‚úÖ Copy-paste installation commands
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific instructions
- ‚úÖ File sizes and compatibility info
- ‚úÖ Security verification steps

---

### 3. Build Artifacts Matrix

| Stack | Platforms | File Format | Size | Build Time | Release Cadence |
|-------|-----------|-------------|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Rust** | 6 platforms | tar.gz/zip | 7-9 MB | ~15-20 min | On-demand |
| **Flutter** | Android + Web | apk/tar.gz | 15 MB + 3 MB | ~10 min | On-demand |

---

### 4. Release Process

**Automated (On Push to Main):**
1. Run tests and analysis
2. Build all artifacts
3. Upload to "development" release tag
4. Deploy Flutter web to GitHub Pages

**Tagged Release (Manual):**
1. Create Git tag: `v1.7.0`
2. Push tag: `git push origin v1.7.0`
3. GitHub Actions:
   - Run all tests
   - Build all platforms
   - Create release notes
   - Upload all artifacts
   - Mark as "Latest Release"

---

### 5. Artifact Naming Convention

**Rust Binaries:**
```
ia-get-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
ia-get-linux-x86_64-musl.tar.gz
ia-get-linux-arm64.tar.gz
ia-get-windows-x86_64.zip
ia-get-macos-intel.tar.gz
ia-get-macos-apple-silicon.tar.gz
```

**Flutter Artifacts:**
```
app-release.apk              (Android Universal APK)
web-bundle.tar.gz           (Web deployment files)
```

**Checksums:**
```
[artifact-name].sha256      (SHA256 hash file)
```

---

### 6. GitHub Pages Deployment

**URL:** `https://gameaday.github.io/ia-get-cli`

**Auto-deploy:**
- Triggered on push to main branch
- Builds Flutter web with `--base-href /ia-get-cli/`
- Deploys to `gh-pages` branch
- Live in ~2-3 minutes

**Features:**
- Responsive web app (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) ready
- Offline-capable with service worker
- Material Design 3 UI

## Comparison: Old vs New

### Old CI/CD
- ‚ùå Monolithic `ci.yml` (735 lines)
- ‚ùå Mixed Rust + Flutter in one workflow
- ‚ùå Complex cache strategies
- ‚ùå FFI integration (removed)
- ‚ùå Hard to understand artifact flow

### New CI/CD
- ‚úÖ Separate workflows (Rust: 150 lines, Flutter: 120 lines)
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Independent build times
- ‚úÖ Pure Dart Flutter (no FFI)
- ‚úÖ Obvious artifact paths

### Old Downloads
- ‚ùå Scattered across README
- ‚ùå Mixed platform instructions
- ‚ùå Unclear which file to download
- ‚ùå No quick install commands

### New Downloads
- ‚úÖ Dedicated `DOWNLOADS.md`
- ‚úÖ Organized by stack (Flutter/Rust)
- ‚úÖ Direct download links
- ‚úÖ Copy-paste install commands
- ‚úÖ Clear platform matrix

2. **Desktop Flutter** - Add Windows/macOS/Linux desktop builds
3. **Automated testing** - Integration tests in CI
4. **Performance benchmarks** - Track build times and artifact sizes
5. **Release notes** - Auto-generate from commits

3. ‚úÖ `DOWNLOADS.md` - Concise downloads and releases page
4. ‚úÖ `docs/CICD_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### To Update:
