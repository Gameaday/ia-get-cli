## What You Need to Do

1. **Add GitHub Secrets** (if not done already)
   - Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-get-cli/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add `CODE_SIGNING_CERT` (base64-encoded certificate)
   - Add `CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD` (certificate password)
   - See `docs/SELF_SIGNED_SETUP.md` for certificate generation

2. **Test It**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0-signing-test
   git push origin v1.0.0-signing-test
   ```

3. **Monitor**
   - Go to: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-get-cli/actions
   - Watch for ‚úÖ on "Sign Windows executable (Self-Signed)"

## About VS Code Warnings

‚ö†Ô∏è **You may see these warnings in VS Code**:
- "Context access might be invalid: CODE_SIGNING_CERT"
- "Context access might be invalid: CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD"

‚úÖ **These are NORMAL and EXPECTED!**
- Secrets are stored in GitHub, not locally
- VS Code can't verify they exist
- Workflow will work fine in GitHub Actions
- **You can safely ignore these warnings**

## What's in release.yml

**Lines 292-327**: Self-signed certificate signing
- Decodes base64 certificate from secret
- Imports to Windows certificate store
- Signs ia-get.exe with timestamp
- Cleans up after signing

**Lines 329-349**: Signature verification

- ‚úÖ Workflow is correct
- ‚úÖ Documentation is complete

**Next step**: Add secrets and test!
