# Project Status & Todo List

**Last Updated**: October 6, 2025

## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 1: Local Code Signing Setup (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Created self-signed certificate for Windows code signing
- ✅ Set up `.secrets/` folder with local credentials (gitignored)
- ✅ Created signing scripts: `local-sign.ps1`, `show-github-secrets.ps1`
- ✅ Tested local signing workflow - signature applied with timestamp
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` with self-signed PowerShell signing
- ✅ Removed all Azure Trusted Signing references
- ✅ Configured Java 21 for Flutter Android builds (gradle.properties)
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Resolved VS Code Azure signing errors (cache/snapshot issues)

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions Setup (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Added CODE_SIGNING_CERT and CODE_SIGNING_PASSWORD to GitHub secrets
- ✅ Created and pushed test tag: v2.0.1-test
- ✅ Triggered GitHub Actions workflow
- ⏳ Monitoring workflow execution

**Commits**:
- 17f2fbe: Add local code signing setup with project secrets and Java 21 configuration
- 065b2f7: Document Phase 1 completion and Phase 2 next steps
- a8bcaea: Add Phase 2 GitHub Actions CI setup checklist
- 673790a: Add GitHub Actions workflow monitoring guide

## 📋 Current Todo List

### Immediate (Phase 2 Continuation)

1. **Monitor GitHub Actions Test Workflow** 🟡 IN PROGRESS
   - URL: https://github.com/Gameaday/ia-get-cli/actions
   - Check v2.0.1-test workflow completion
   - Verify Windows signing step succeeds
   - Review build results (Rust CLI vs Flutter mobile)

2. **Review Test Workflow Results**
   - Analyze which builds succeeded vs failed
   - Expected: Rust CLI builds should succeed
   - Expected: Flutter mobile may fail (stubs/incomplete)
   - Document any signing-specific issues

3. **Verify Signed Windows Executable**
   - Download: ia-get-v2.0.1-test-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
   - Verify signature: `Get-AuthenticodeSignature ia-get.exe`
   - Confirm: Certificate CN, Thumbprint, Timestamp

4. **Clean Up Test Release** (optional)
   ```bash
   git tag -d v2.0.1-test
   git push origin :refs/tags/v2.0.1-test
   ```

### Documentation & User Experience

5. **Document Windows User Experience**
   - Test signed executable on Windows
   - Document SmartScreen warnings users will see
   - Create installation guide for self-signed cert
   - Update README with Windows-specific instructions

6. **Update Project Documentation**
   - Add "Installation" section to README
   - Document self-signed certificate limitations
   - Add troubleshooting for Windows SmartScreen
   - Link to release process documentation

### Future Phases

7. **Complete Flutter Mobile Implementation** (Future Phase 3)
   - Finish Flutter mobile app (currently stubs)
   - This will resolve Java/Gradle version errors
   - Enable mobile builds in CI/CD
   - Test Android APK/AAB signing

8. **Production Release** (After verification)
   - Create production tag: v2.0.1
   - Monitor production release workflow
   - Announce release
   - Update documentation

9. **Consider CA-Signed Certificate** (Optional/Future)
   - Research affordable code signing certificate options
   - Budget: ~$100-300/year for OV certificate
   - Would eliminate Windows SmartScreen warnings
   - Evaluate cost vs benefit

## 🚫 Known Issues (Expected/Deferred)

### Flutter Mobile Build Errors (Expected - Future Phase)
**Status**: Deferred to Phase 3  
**Files**: `mobile/flutter/android/build.gradle`, `mobile/flutter/android/app/build.gradle`  
**Error**: "Unsupported class file major version 68"  
**Cause**: Flutter mobile app is stub/incomplete for future phase  
**Resolution**: Will be fixed when completing Flutter mobile implementation  
**Impact**: Does not affect Rust CLI builds or Windows code signing
