# Mobile App Migrated ‚ú®# Mobile App - README



The **IA Helper** Flutter mobile app has been moved to its own dedicated repository:This directory contains the Flutter mobile application.



## üîó New Location## Overview



### [**github.com/gameaday/ia-helper**](https://github.com/gameaday/ia-helper)The mobile app uses a **pure Dart implementation** for accessing Internet Archive content. This provides:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)

---- Standard Flutter development workflow

- No native build dependencies

## üì± Why the Move?- Fast build times without native compilation



The mobile app now lives in a separate repository for several great reasons:## Architecture



### ‚úÖ Benefits```

Flutter/Dart App

1. **Faster Development**    ‚Üì (HTTP API)

   - No more waiting for Rust builds when working on FlutterInternet Archive JSON API

   - No more Flutter builds when working on Rust```

   - 50% faster CI/CD pipeline

### Key Design Principles

2. **Clear Product Identity**

   - **IA Get**: Command-line power tool for automation1. **Pure Dart Implementation**: All functionality is implemented in Dart, making it portable and easy to maintain.

   - **IA Helper**: Mobile companion app for browsing

   - Each has focused documentation and development2. **Standard Flutter Architecture**: Uses standard Flutter packages and follows Flutter best practices.



3. **Independent Releases**3. **API-First Design**: Direct communication with Internet Archive's JSON API using Dart's http package.

   - Mobile app can release on its own schedule

   - CLI tool can evolve independently## Building

   - No forced version synchronization

### Development Build

4. **Better Play Store Experience**```bash

   - Repository contains only mobile app codecd mobile/flutter

   - All documentation is mobile-focusedflutter pub get

   - Clearer for Google Play reviewersflutter run

```

5. **Smaller Repositories**

   - Mobile devs don't need Rust toolchain### Android APK Build

   - CLI devs don't need Flutter SDK```bash

   - Faster clones, focused development# From project root

./scripts/build-mobile.sh --development

---

# Or directly with Flutter

## üÜï New Brandingcd mobile/flutter

flutter build apk

The mobile app has been rebranded from **"IA Get"** to **"IA Helper"** to better reflect its role as a complete Internet Archive companion app.```



### What Changed### Production Build

```bash

- **App Name**: IA Get ‚Üí **IA Helper**# From project root

- **Package**: `com.gameaday.iagetcli` ‚Üí `com.gameaday.iahelper`./scripts/build-mobile.sh --production --store-ready

- **Positioning**: "Downloader" ‚Üí **"Internet Archive Companion"**

- **Repository**: ia-get-cli ‚Üí **ia-helper**# Or build both APK and App Bundle

./scripts/build-mobile.sh --production --appbundle --store-ready

---```

### Debug on Device

## üîß This Repository (ia-get-cli)```bash

cd mobile/flutter

This repository now focuses exclusively on the **Rust command-line tool**:flutter run -v  # Verbose output for debugging

```

- ‚ö° High-performance concurrent downloads

- üñºÔ∏è Optional desktop GUI (egui)## Flutter Integration

- ‚å®Ô∏è Powerful CLI for automation

- üóúÔ∏è HTTP compression supportThe Flutter app communicates directly with the Internet Archive API using standard HTTP requests. See `mobile/flutter/lib/services/` for the service implementations.

- üéØ Advanced filtering
