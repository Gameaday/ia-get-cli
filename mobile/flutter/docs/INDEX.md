## 📝 Documentation Standards

### When to Create New Documentation
1. **Major Phase Completion**: Create a consolidated completion summary
2. **Significant Feature**: Create a feature-specific document in `features/`
3. **Architecture Change**: Update `ROADMAP_ANALYSIS.md` or create new architecture doc
4. **Release**: Update `RELEASE_NOTES_*.md` and post-release roadmap

### When NOT to Create New Documentation
1. **Small Tasks**: Add to existing phase document
2. **Bug Fixes**: Commit message is sufficient
3. **Refactoring**: Commit message + optional note in completion doc
4. **Routine Updates**: Use PR description or commit messages

### Naming Conventions
- **Completion Summaries**: `PHASES_X-Y_COMPLETE.md`
- **Planning Documents**: `PHASE_X-Y_PLAN.md`
- **Feature Reports**: `FEATURE_NAME_COMPLETE.md` in `features/`
- **Roadmaps**: `*_ROADMAP.md`
- **Use uppercase for major docs, lowercase for feature-specific**
