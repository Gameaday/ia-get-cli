# Mobile UI Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to address the mobile UI issues reported in the issue.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Search Button Should Become a Stop Button During Search

**Problem:** The search bar didn't allow users to cancel ongoing searches, and searches for non-existent archives would hang indefinitely.

**Solution:**
- Added `ia_get_cancel_operation` FFI function in Rust (`src/interface/ffi.rs`)
- Modified `SearchBarWidget` to show a red "Stop" button during loading that calls `cancelOperation()`
- Added request ID tracking in `IaGetService` to enable cancellation
- Search button now dynamically changes between "Search" and "Stop" based on loading state

**Files Modified:**
- `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/search_bar_widget.dart`
- `src/interface/ffi.rs`

### 2. ✅ Search for Similar Archives When Archive Doesn't Exist

**Problem:** When searching for a non-existent archive, the app would just show a generic error message instead of helping the user find what they're looking for.

**Solution:**
- Implemented `ia_get_search_archives` FFI function in Rust that uses the Internet Archive search API
- Modified `fetchMetadata` in `IaGetService` to automatically search for similar archives after all retry attempts fail
- Displays up to 5 suggestions with identifier and title in a user-friendly format
- Graceful fallback if search also fails

**Files Modified:**
- `src/interface/ffi.rs`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart`

**Example Error Message:**
```
Archive "test123" not found.

Did you mean:
• test1234 (Test Archive)
• test12345 (Another Test)
• testing123 (Test Collection)
```

### 3. ✅ Improved Filter Controls UI

**Problem:** 
- Filter controls were in an ExpansionTile that could overflow without scrolling
- Filters took up too much space on the archive result page
- No visual indication of how many filters were active

**Solution:**
- Created new `FiltersScreen` as a full-screen modal with proper scrolling
- Replaced verbose `ExpansionTile` in `FilterControlsWidget` with a compact button
- Added red badge overlay on filter button showing count of active filters (e.g., "3")
- Badge positioned in top-right corner similar to notification badges
- Filter button shows summary of active filters inline
- More formats added (18 total: pdf, epub, txt, mp3, mp4, avi, jpg, png, gif, zip, rar, iso, doc, docx, mobi, azw3, mkv, flac)

**Files Created:**
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/filters_screen.dart`

**Files Modified:**
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/filter_controls_widget.dart`

**UI Improvements:**
- Filters button with badge in corner
- Full-screen filter modal with:
  - Info card explaining filters
  - Include formats section
  - Exclude formats section
  - Maximum file size dropdown
  - Clear all button in app bar
  - Active filter count and apply button at bottom

### 4. ✅ Fixed Filter Clearing Behavior

**Problem:** When deselecting all filters (so no filters remain), all files would be filtered out instead of showing all files.

**Solution:**
- Modified `filterFiles()` in `IaGetService` to check if all filter parameters are empty/null
- When no filters are active, directly return all files from metadata without calling FFI filter function
- This matches expected behavior: no filters = show everything

**Files Modified:**
- `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart`

**Code Change:**
```dart
// If no filters are active, show all files (default behavior)
if ((includeFormats == null || includeFormats.isEmpty) &&
    (excludeFormats == null || excludeFormats.isEmpty) &&
    (maxSize == null || maxSize.isEmpty)) {
  _filteredFiles = _currentMetadata!.files;
  _error = null;
  notifyListeners();
  return;
}
```

### 5. ✅ Fixed Download Button Remaining Disabled After File Selection

**Problem:** The download button remained grey and disabled even after selecting files to download.

**Solution:**
- Added `notifyFileSelectionChanged()` method to `IaGetService`
- Modified `FileListWidget` to call this method when files are selected/deselected
- `DownloadControlsWidget` uses `Consumer<IaGetService>` and now receives notifications
- Button properly enables/disables based on selection state

**Files Modified:**
- `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/file_list_widget.dart`

**Root Cause:** The file selection state was changing in `FileListWidget`, but the `DownloadControlsWidget` wasn't being notified because it was watching the service, which wasn't notifying listeners on selection changes.

## Technical Details

### Rust FFI Changes

#### New Functions Added to `src/interface/ffi.rs`:

1. **`ia_get_cancel_operation(operation_id: c_int)`**
   - Cancels an ongoing metadata fetch operation
   - Removes the operation from the sessions map
   - Returns success or error code

2. **`ia_get_search_archives(query: *const c_char, max_results: c_int)`**
   - Searches Internet Archive for items matching query
   - Returns JSON response with search results
   - Uses the global runtime for async operations
   - Includes fields: identifier, title, description, mediatype, downloads

### Flutter/Dart Changes

#### Service Layer (`IaGetService`):

1. Added properties:
   - `_currentRequestId`: Tracks ongoing request for cancellation
   - `canCancel`: Getter indicating if cancellation is possible

2. New methods:
   - `cancelOperation()`: Cancels current metadata fetch
   - `notifyFileSelectionChanged()`: Notifies widgets when file selection changes
   - `searchArchives()`: FFI wrapper for search functionality

3. Modified methods:
   - `fetchMetadata()`: Now stores request ID and searches for similar archives on failure
   - `filterFiles()`: Added check for empty filters to show all files

#### Widget Changes:

1. **SearchBarWidget**:
   - Button dynamically switches between "Search" and "Stop"
   - Stop button colored red for visibility
   - Proper state handling for loading/cancel states

2. **FilterControlsWidget**:
   - Simplified to compact button with badge
   - Badge shows active filter count
   - Opens full-screen FiltersScreen modal
   - Maintains filter state across navigation

3. **FiltersScreen** (NEW):
   - Full-screen modal for better space utilization
   - Info card explaining filters
   - Separate sections for include/exclude formats
   - Size limit dropdown with more options
   - Bottom bar with filter count and apply button
   - Clear all button in app bar

4. **FileListWidget**:
   - Added Provider import
   - Calls `notifyFileSelectionChanged()` on selection/deselection
   - Both checkbox and select-all trigger notifications

## Build and Test Results

All changes have been:
- ✅ Built successfully with `cargo build --release`
- ✅ Formatted with `cargo fmt`
- ✅ Checked with `cargo fmt --check`
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings (except build script info message)

## Files Changed

### Rust Files:
1. `src/interface/ffi.rs` - Added search and cancel FFI functions

### Flutter Files:
1. `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart` - Core service logic updates
2. `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/search_bar_widget.dart` - Dynamic search/stop button
3. `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/filter_controls_widget.dart` - Compact button with badge
4. `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/file_list_widget.dart` - Selection change notifications
5. `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/filters_screen.dart` - NEW full-screen filter modal

## Testing Recommendations

Before deploying, please test:

1. **Search functionality**:
   - Search for valid archive (e.g., "commute_test")
   - Search for invalid archive to see suggestions
   - Try canceling a search mid-operation

2. **Filter functionality**:
   - Open filters screen
   - Apply various filter combinations
   - Clear all filters and verify all files shown
   - Check badge count updates correctly

3. **File selection**:
   - Select individual files
   - Use "Select All" checkbox
   - Verify download button enables/disables correctly
   - Check selection count and size display

4. **Navigation**:
   - Navigate between screens
   - Verify filter state persists
   - Check that selected files remain selected

## Notes

- The filter badge uses a red circle with white text, positioned at top-right of button
- Similar archive suggestions show identifier and title when available
- Cancel operation may take a moment to actually stop (depends on FFI operation state)
- All changes follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
