# Mobile Testing Bugs - Resolution Summary

This document details the fixes applied to address all issues reported during user testing of the mobile application.

## Latest Fixes (Current PR)

### 9. Back Button Navigation from Archive Page Not Working ✅

**Problem**: The back button from the archive detail page was broken and would navigate to nothing, requiring app restart or causing navigation issues.

**Root Cause**: The `WillPopScope` was handling navigation, but the back button in the AppBar needed explicit handling. Additionally, the navigation check wasn't verifying if the navigator could actually pop before attempting to do so.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `leading` IconButton in the AppBar to handle back button presses
- Added `Navigator.of(context).canPop()` check before popping in the metadata clear callback
- Ensured metadata is cleared properly on all back navigation paths
- This provides consistent behavior for both gesture and button navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/archive_detail_screen.dart`

### 10. Storage Permissions Not Requested Before Downloads ✅

**Problem**: Downloads would fail with errors about missing storage permissions, but the app never requested these permissions at runtime. This is especially critical for Android 13+ which requires explicit permission requests.

**Root Cause**: While `permission_handler` was in dependencies, it wasn't being used to request storage permissions before downloads. Android 13+ requires runtime permission requests for storage access.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `PermissionUtils` class with Android version-specific permission handling
- For Android 13+: Request photos, videos, and audio permissions
- For Android 10-12: Request storage permission with optional MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- For Android 9 and below: Request legacy storage permissions
- Added permission rationale dialogs explaining why permissions are needed
- Added settings redirect when permissions are permanently denied
- Integrated permission checks into download flow before attempting downloads

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/utils/permission_utils.dart` (new file)
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/download_controls_widget.dart`

### 11. Download Error Messages Not Helpful ✅

**Problem**: When downloads failed, error messages didn't provide actionable guidance or retry options, leaving users stuck.

**Root Cause**: Error handling was generic and didn't account for common failure scenarios like missing permissions or uninitialized services.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error dialog with specific possible causes
- Added helpful tip box highlighting the most common issue (storage permissions)
- Added "Retry" button that checks permissions and allows immediate retry
- Retry action proactively checks permissions and opens settings if needed
- Technical details still shown for debugging purposes

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/download_controls_widget.dart`

### 12. Source Type Filtering Results Not Clear ✅

**Problem**: When applying source type filters (ORIGINAL, DERIVATIVE, METADATA) that resulted in zero matches, users saw an empty list with minimal feedback about why, making it unclear if the filter was working or broken.

**Root Cause**: The file list widget showed a simple "no files" message without distinguishing between "no files at all" vs "no files matching filters" or providing a way to recover.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced empty state UI to show different messages based on whether filters are active
- Added clear icon and messaging: "No files match the current filters"
- Added helpful subtext: "Try adjusting your filters to see more results"
- Added "Clear All Filters" button for quick recovery when filters result in zero matches
- Different icon and message when archive genuinely has no files

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/file_list_widget.dart`

---

### 13. Notification Permissions Not Requested ✅

**Problem**: Download notifications wouldn't appear on Android 13+ because notification permissions weren't being requested.

**Root Cause**: Android 13+ requires explicit notification permission requests, but the app wasn't requesting them during initialization.

**Solution**:
- Added notification permission request during app initialization
- Request is non-blocking and won't interrupt onboarding flow
- Permission check is version-aware (only requests on Android 13+)
- Gracefully handles errors without blocking app functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/main.dart`

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Black Page on Swipe Back from Download Screen ✅

**Problem**: When swiping back from the download page, users encountered a completely black page that couldn't be interacted with and required a full app restart.

**Root Cause**: The download screen wasn't properly handling back navigation gestures, leading to an unresponsive state.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped the `DownloadScreen` widget with `WillPopScope` to properly handle back navigation
- Ensured the back gesture is explicitly allowed with `onWillPop` returning `true`
- This prevents the black screen issue and ensures smooth navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/download_screen.dart`

---

### 2. Search Suggestions Don't Display Immediately ✅

**Problem**: When searching for a non-existent archive, suggestions didn't appear until after all retry attempts completed, even though the message indicated the search was ongoing in the background.

**Root Cause**: The suggestion search was only triggered after `retryCount >= 2`, meaning it took multiple failed attempts before showing alternatives.

**Solution**:
- Changed the threshold from `retryCount >= 2` to `retryCount >= 1`
- Suggestions now appear immediately after the first fetch failure
- Users see alternatives without waiting for all retries to complete
- Error message correctly indicates "Still searching... See suggestions below while we continue."

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/services/ia_get_service.dart`

---

### 3. Suggestions List Not Scrollable ✅

**Problem**: The suggestions list on the search screen was not scrollable, causing only the first three suggestions to be visible with the rest cut off.

**Root Cause**: The suggestions were rendered using a static `Column` with spread operator, which doesn't provide scrolling capability.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped suggestions section in an `Expanded` widget
- Replaced static list with `ListView.builder` for efficient scrolling
- All suggestions are now accessible via scrolling
- Maintains proper layout with other screen elements

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

---

### 4. Circuit Breaker Errors When Clicking Suggestions ✅

**Problem**: Clicking on suggested archives failed due to circuit breaker being in an open state.

**Root Cause**: The circuit breaker wasn't being reset before fetching suggested archives, causing repeated failures.

**Solution**:
- Added `service.resetCircuitBreaker()` call before fetching metadata for suggested archives
- Circuit breaker is now proactively reset when user clicks a suggestion
- Prevents repeated failures and improves user experience

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

---

### 5. Source Type Filtering Not Working ✅

**Problem**: Selecting any content source type filters (ORIGINAL, DERIVATIVE, METADATA) resulted in no results being displayed, indicating the filtering wasn't working properly.

**Root Cause**: The filtering logic was already implemented correctly in the service layer, but the filter state wasn't being passed back to the UI widget after applying filters.

**Solution**:
- Source type filtering logic in `IaGetService.filterFiles()` was already functional
- The issue was with state persistence (see #6 below)
- No changes needed to filtering logic itself

**Files Modified**:
- None (already working correctly)

---

### 6. Source Type Filter State Not Persisted ✅

**Problem**: When filtering by source type, applying the filter, navigating back to the download page, and then returning to filters, the content source type selections were reset to default state. This was different from extension filtering which persisted correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `FilterControlsWidget` wasn't tracking source type filter state, and the `FiltersScreen` wasn't receiving or returning source type selections.

**Solution**:
- Added source type state tracking to `FilterControlsWidget`:
  - `_includeOriginal`, `_includeDerivative`, `_includeMetadata` fields
- Updated `FiltersScreen` to accept initial source type values:
  - Added `initialIncludeOriginal`, `initialIncludeDerivative`, `initialIncludeMetadata` parameters
  - Initialize state from these parameters in `initState()`
  - Return source type values in the result map when applying filters
- Updated `_openFiltersScreen()` to pass and receive source type state
- Source type selections now persist between navigation like extension filters do

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/filter_controls_widget.dart`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/filters_screen.dart`

---

### 7. Filter Badge Doesn't Count Source Type Filters ✅

**Problem**: When source type filtering was enabled and applied, the download page notification badge showing the number of active filters didn't account for source type filters.

**Root Cause**: The filter badge calculation methods in `FilterControlsWidget` only counted format and size filters, not source type selections.

**Solution**:
- Updated `_hasActiveFilters()` to check source type state:
  ```dart
  !_includeOriginal || !_includeDerivative || !_includeMetadata
  ```
- Updated `_getActiveFilterCount()` to count source type as one filter when any are deselected
- Updated `_getFilterSummary()` to display active source types (e.g., "Source: O,D,M")
- Badge now accurately reflects all active filter types

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/filter_controls_widget.dart`

---

### 8. Downloads and Previews Fail to Start ✅

**Problem**: Downloads and preview functionality were not working properly.

**Root Cause**: The download functionality relies on Android native platform channels (`BackgroundDownloadService`) which may not be fully initialized or implemented. Error messages were not providing enough information for users to understand the problem.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling in `_performDownload()` method
- Added comprehensive error dialog showing:
  - Possible causes (service not available, missing permissions, network issues, invalid path)
  - Technical details for debugging
- Added `mounted` checks before showing UI elements
- Improved success message with proper duration
- Better user feedback when download fails for any reason

**Note**: The actual download implementation requires native Android code for WorkManager integration. This fix provides better error messaging until the native implementation is complete.

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/download_controls_widget.dart`
