## Detailed Issue Analysis

### 1. Back Swipe Black Screen ✅ Already Fixed

**Status**: This issue was already fixed in previous PRs:

**Documentation**: See `MOBILE_TESTING_BUGS_FIX.md` issues #1 and #9

### 2. Download Settings Modal Size ✅ Fixed in This PR

**Original Problem**: Download settings page that goes up from bottom when you click the gear next to file selected covers the entire screen. For elegance and to make it clear how to close it, have it only go up and cover as much screen as it needs.

**Root Cause**: The modal used `DraggableScrollableSheet` with fixed percentage sizes:
- `initialChildSize: 0.7` (70% of screen)
- `maxChildSize: 0.9` (90% of screen)
- `minChildSize: 0.5` (50% of screen)

This forced the modal to take up a large portion of the screen regardless of content amount.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Replaced `DraggableScrollableSheet` with a simple `Column` using `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min`
2. Modal now sizes to its content (wrap_content behavior)
3. Added rounded top corners (`BorderRadius.vertical`) for better visual appearance
4. Added proper keyboard padding support with `MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom`
5. Added `contentPadding: EdgeInsets.zero` to `SwitchListTile` widgets to reduce extra spacing
6. Kept the drag handle at the top to clearly indicate dismissal method
7. More of the underlying screen is now visible, making it clearer how to close the modal

**Benefits**:
- More elegant presentation
- Clear visual indication of how to dismiss
- Better use of screen space
- Still scrollable if content exceeds screen height
- Responsive to keyboard appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/download_controls_widget.dart`

**Documentation**: Added to `MOBILE_TESTING_BUGS_FIX.md` as issue #14

### 3. Downloads and Previews Fail After Permissions ✅ Already Fixed

**Original Problem**: Even after approving all permissions downloads and previews still fail to start.

**Status**: This issue was already fixed in previous PRs with comprehensive permission handling:
- Issue #8: Enhanced error handling for downloads
- Issue #10: Added storage permission requests before downloads
- Issue #11: Improved error messages with retry functionality

**What Was Fixed**:
1. Created comprehensive `PermissionUtils` class with Android version-aware handling
2. Added permission rationale dialogs explaining why permissions are needed
3. Added settings redirect when permissions are permanently denied
4. Integrated permission checks into download flow before attempting downloads
5. Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance and retry options

**Documentation**: See `MOBILE_TESTING_BUGS_FIX.md` issues #8, #10, and #11

### 4. Content Source Type Filters ✅ Already Fixed

**Original Problem**: Content source type filters selections do not work properly, they do not remember or save properly and they also filter improperly. Should be handled closer to how the rest of the filters are implemented.

**Status**: This issue was already fixed in previous PRs:
- Issue #5: Source type filtering logic (was already working)
- Issue #6: Source type filter state persistence
- Issue #7: Filter badge counting source type filters
- Issue #12: Clear feedback when filters result in no matches

**What Was Fixed**:
1. Added source type state tracking to `FilterControlsWidget`
2. Updated `FiltersScreen` to accept and return source type values
3. Source type selections now persist between navigation
4. Filter badge counts source type filters correctly
5. Enhanced empty state UI for clear feedback when filters result in no matches
6. Added "Clear All Filters" button for quick recovery

**Documentation**: See `MOBILE_TESTING_BUGS_FIX.md` issues #5, #6, #7, and #12
