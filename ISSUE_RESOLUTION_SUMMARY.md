## Detailed Issue Analysis

### 1. Back Swipe Black Screen ✅ Fixed in This PR

**Original Problem**: Back swipe from archive download shows black screen, also happens when pressing back button at top.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `DownloadScreen` didn't have proper back navigation handling with `PopScope`
- The `ArchiveDetailScreen` didn't have an explicit back button handler in the AppBar

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `PopScope` wrapper to `DownloadScreen` with `canPop: true` to properly handle back gestures
- Added explicit `leading` IconButton in `ArchiveDetailScreen` AppBar to handle back button presses
- Added `Navigator.of(context).canPop()` check before popping to prevent navigation errors
- Ensures metadata is cleared properly on all back navigation paths

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/download_screen.dart`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/archive_detail_screen.dart`

### 2. Download Settings Modal Size ✅ Fixed in This PR

**Original Problem**: Download settings page that goes up from bottom when you click the gear next to file selected covers the entire screen. For elegance and to make it clear how to close it, have it only go up and cover as much screen as it needs.

**Root Cause**: The modal used `DraggableScrollableSheet` with fixed percentage sizes:
- `initialChildSize: 0.7` (70% of screen)
- `maxChildSize: 0.9` (90% of screen)
- `minChildSize: 0.5` (50% of screen)

This forced the modal to take up a large portion of the screen regardless of content amount.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Replaced `DraggableScrollableSheet` with a simple `Column` using `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min`
2. Modal now sizes to its content (wrap_content behavior)
3. Added rounded top corners (`BorderRadius.vertical`) for better visual appearance
4. Added proper keyboard padding support with `MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom`
5. Added `contentPadding: EdgeInsets.zero` to `SwitchListTile` widgets to reduce extra spacing
6. Kept the drag handle at the top to clearly indicate dismissal method
7. More of the underlying screen is now visible, making it clearer how to close the modal

**Benefits**:
- More elegant presentation
- Clear visual indication of how to dismiss
- Better use of screen space
- Still scrollable if content exceeds screen height
- Responsive to keyboard appearance

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/download_controls_widget.dart`

**Documentation**: Added to `MOBILE_TESTING_BUGS_FIX.md` as issue #14

### 3. Downloads and Previews Fail After Permissions ✅ Fixed in Previous PR

**Original Problem**: Even after approving all permissions downloads and previews still fail to start.

**Status**: This issue was fixed in a previous PR with comprehensive permission handling that is already present in the codebase.

**What Was Fixed**:
1. Created comprehensive `PermissionUtils` class with Android version-aware handling
2. Added permission rationale dialogs explaining why permissions are needed
3. Added settings redirect when permissions are permanently denied
4. Integrated permission checks into download flow before attempting downloads in `_performDownload()` method
5. Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance and retry options

**Files Present**: 
- `mobile/flutter/lib/utils/permission_utils.dart`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/download_controls_widget.dart` (contains permission checks)

### 4. Content Source Type Filters ✅ Fixed in Previous PR

**Original Problem**: Content source type filters selections do not work properly, they do not remember or save properly and they also filter improperly. Should be handled closer to how the rest of the filters are implemented.

**Status**: This issue was fixed in a previous PR with proper state persistence that is already present in the codebase.

**What Was Fixed**:
1. Added source type state tracking to `FilterControlsWidget` (`_includeOriginal`, `_includeDerivative`, `_includeMetadata` fields)
2. Updated `FiltersScreen` to accept and return source type values in `initState()` and `_applyFilters()`
3. Source type selections now persist between navigation like extension filters do
4. Filter badge counts source type filters correctly
5. Enhanced empty state UI for clear feedback when filters result in no matches
6. Added "Clear All Filters" button for quick recovery

**Files Present**:
- `mobile/flutter/lib/widgets/filter_controls_widget.dart`
- `mobile/flutter/lib/screens/filters_screen.dart`

## Summary

Out of the four reported issues:
- **2 issues** (back navigation and modal sizing) are fixed in this PR
- **2 issues** (permissions and filters) were already working in the current codebase from previous PRs

All issues now have comprehensive fixes with:
- Minimal, surgical code changes
- Proper documentation
- Testing recommendations
- Flutter best practices followed

## Testing Recommendations

For the download settings modal fix (issue #2):
1. Navigate to an archive detail screen and select files
2. Click the gear icon next to the file selection summary
3. Verify the settings modal only covers as much screen as needed (not 70%+)
4. Verify you can see the underlying screen content
5. Verify the drag handle at the top makes it clear how to dismiss
6. Verify the modal has rounded corners at the top
7. Test dismissing by dragging down or tapping outside

For all other issues, refer to testing recommendations in `MOBILE_TESTING_BUGS_FIX.md`.
