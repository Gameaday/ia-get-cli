# GitHub Copilot Instructions for ia-get

## Project Overview
This is a Rust CLI tool for downloading files from the Internet Archive, built with standard Cargo toolchain for simplicity and reliability.

## Development Guidelines

### Rust Standards
- Follow standard Rust conventions and idiomatic patterns
- Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` for code formatting and linting
- Prefer explicit error handling with `Result<T, E>` types
- Use `anyhow` or `thiserror` for error handling consistency

### Build System
- This project uses standard Cargo toolchain for all operations
- Use `cargo build` for development builds and `cargo build --release` for optimized builds
- Run tests with `cargo test` and linting with `cargo clippy`
- Maintain compatibility with standard Rust compilation targets
- **Always run `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo fmt` at the end of every PR to ensure consistent code formatting**

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-justified
- Update Cargo.lock when adding new dependencies
- Prefer crates that are well-maintained and have good ecosystem support

### Code Structure
- Follow CLI best practices with clear subcommands and help text
- Use structured logging for better debugging
- Implement proper signal handling for long-running downloads
- Include comprehensive error messages for user-facing operations

### Testing
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Include integration tests for CLI behavior
- Test cross-platform compatibility where relevant

### Documentation
- Update README.md for any new features or usage changes
- Include examples in help text and documentation
- Document any Internet Archive API specifics or limitations
