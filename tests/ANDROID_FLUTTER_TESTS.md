# Android Flutter Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Android Flutter features.

## Test Coverage

### Background Download Service Tests (6 test cases)
- Service initialization and method channel setup
- Download creation and lifecycle management  
- Download control operations (pause, resume, cancel)
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Error handling and recovery

### Notification Service Tests (4 test cases)
- Notification channel configuration
- Permission handling for Android 13+
- Progress notification creation with actions
- Completion and error notifications

### Download Progress Model Tests (4 test cases)
- Model creation and field validation
- Copy operations with updated fields
- Formatting utilities (speed, ETA, file sizes)
- Null value handling and edge cases

### Mock Infrastructure
- Complete platform channel mocking
- Realistic method call simulation
- State management validation
- Error condition testing

## Running Tests

Since Flutter is not available in this environment, the tests are designed to be run with:

```bash
cd mobile/flutter
flutter test test/android_features_test.dart
```

## Test Structure

The tests follow Flutter testing best practices:
- Proper test setup and teardown
- Mock method channel handlers
- State verification
- Edge case coverage

All tests are designed to validate the Android-specific functionality without requiring actual device connectivity, making them suitable for CI/CD environments.
